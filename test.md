About 10 million Americans between the age of 18 and 35 – or the group termed millennials – are  [playing the role of a family caregiver](http://time.com/5282340/millennial-caregivers-baby-boomers/), providing essential yet often unpaid work, a  [new report](https://www.aarp.org/ppi/info-2018/millennial-family-caregiving.html) by American lobby group AARP (formerly known as American Association of Retired Persons) found.

Although the typical profile of an unpaid family caregiver in the US is a 49-year-old white woman, there is a new trend as millennials increasingly make up a growing group who have to balance caregiving with employment, as baby boomers age and need more support. It’s a challenging role, as the report found that millennials spend about 21 hours a week on caregiving, the equivalent of a part-time job. More than half of millennial caregivers earn less than $50,000 a year, but spend almost a third of their income on caregiving-related expenses. Many also have some form of debt, such as student loans.

The role of a caregiver is both critical and challenging. But because most feel bound to their caregiving tasks by a sense of duty, they  [tend not to speak out when they need help](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/caregivers-need-change-mindset) or support from others. In Singapore, the National Council of Social Service is  [conducting a study to better understand the work that caregivers do](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/study-on-caregivers-and-the-support-they-need), their psychological needs and ties to the ones they care for, and the support they require.
