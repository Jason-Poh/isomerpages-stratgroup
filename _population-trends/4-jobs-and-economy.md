### **Economy**

Our economy has performed well over the years, despite challenging times, including the bursting of the dot-com bubble (2001), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (2003) and the Global Financial Crisis (2008). As the economy continues to mature and local workforce growth slows, we can expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth to moderate.  

Given this, productivity growth has become more crucial in our drive to achieve sustainable economic growth, raise real wages and improve the living standards of Singaporeans in years to come.
