### **Economy**

Our economy has performed well over the years, despite challenging times, including the bursting of the dot-com bubble (2001), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (2003) and the Global Financial Crisis (2008). As the economy continues to mature and local workforce growth slows, we can expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth to moderate.  

Given this, productivity growth has become more crucial in our drive to achieve sustainable economic growth, raise real wages and improve the living standards of Singaporeans in years to come.

Business cost is a key consideration for companies and influences Singaporeâ€™s overall attractiveness as a business location relative to the rest of Asia and other economies. We want to attract businesses here to create high-value jobs for Singaporeans.

The cost of labour makes up a big part of business cost for companies in the Manufacturing sector. Due to manpower shortage and low productivity gains amidst a sluggish global economy, wage growth has outstripped productivity gains in recent years. This has led to a rise in unit labour cost, which has in turn contributed to an increase in unit business cost for companies. Between 2011 and 2015, the unit business cost index for the Manufacturing sector (UBCI) rose by 2.5% p.a. This underscores the importance of raising productivity in order to ensure that Singapore remains competitive.

Beyond business cost, companies also take into account factors such as the availability of skilled and suitable workers and the conduciveness of the business environment when deciding where to locate. Hence, it is important to continue ensuring these, for Singapore to remain an attractive investment location for high-value added activities, thereby helping to create good jobs for Singaporeans.
