### **Transport**

Having an adequate transport capacity is key to ensuring quality living and pleasant commuting experiences. Rail density reflects the extension of our rail network taking into consideration our total population size.

We have seen an improvement in our rail density in recent years.

### **Housing**

Ensuring affordable public housing and sufficient housing supply are important in supporting Singaporeansâ€™ aspirations to own their homes and set up families. The Resale Price Index (RPI) reflects the matching of the demand and supply of public housing, and helps us to monitor if public housing remains affordable for Singaporeans.

The RPI declined in 2013 and 2014, and remained stable in recent quarters.

More residents are able to own their homes. The home ownership rates have improved over time.

### **Green Spaces**

Besides ensuring the capacity of our physical infrastructure and balancing our various land use needs, we also want to improve park accessibility so that our people can enjoy more attractive green spaces.  

The area of regional parks and total length of park connectors has been steadily rising over the years.
