### **Marriages**

Singaporeans are marrying later. However, the median age at first marriage has remained relatively stable in recent years.

There were about 24,400 citizen marriages in 2017, compared to about 23,900 citizen marriages in 2016.

### **Births**

Our TFR was 1.16 in 2017.

There were 32,400 citizen births in 2017, compared to 33,200 in 2016.

What could this trend mean for our future?  

Our TFR has fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 for four decades since 1976. A declining TFR means that the size of the younger cohorts will shrink. At the current TFR and with no immigration, our citizen population could start to shrink from around 2020 onwards.
