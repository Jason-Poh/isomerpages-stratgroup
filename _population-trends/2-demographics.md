### **Population**

Our total population is made up of Singapore citizens, Permanent Residents (PRs) and non-residents. The non-resident population is a diverse group who are here for work, study or family reasons. As of June 2018, the total population size is 5.64 million.

With stable growth in the citizen population, our total population grew slightly by 0.5% over the past year.

Growth in non-resident population has slowed since 2013. In contrast, citizen population grew at a steady pace through births and immigration, while PR population remained relatively stable.
