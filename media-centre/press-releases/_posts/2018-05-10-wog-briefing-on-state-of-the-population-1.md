Singapore’s population hit 4.84 million in June 2008, a 5.5% increase from the 4.59 million in June 2007. The Government released this figure, together with a range of other population-related information in the first-ever “State of the Population” briefing to the media on 26 Sep 2008. The briefing was coordinated by the National Population Secretariat (NPS) in the Prime Minister’s Office. The briefing also involved relevant government agencies such as the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS), Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), and Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

Mr Roy Quek, Director of the NPS, said: “There is much greater interest in population-related information among the public. Through this coordinated briefing, the Government seeks to provide the public with a more coherent and comprehensive picture of the state of the population in Singapore. Even as our total population is growing, there are some underlying factors such as our continued low fertility rate that present significant demographic challenges to Singapore. We hope to raise awareness of these challenges and provide a proper context to the population policies that the Government has put in place.”

#### **STATE OF SINGAPORE’S POPULATION**

Growing total population. As of June 2008, Singapore’s total population stood at 4.84 million, higher than 4.59 million as at June 2007. All three segments of the population – citizens, Permanent Residents (PR) and non-residents – recorded absolute growth in the past year. The number of citizens, for example, grew from 3.13 million to 3.16 million. This is attributed to a slightly higher number of citizen babies as well as more PRs taking up Singapore citizenship.

#### **FERTILITY**

Total fertility rate still low but more births were registered. Singapore’s resident total fertility rate (TFR) rose slightly from 1.28 in 2006 to 1.29 in 2007. There were 18,032 resident births registered in the first six months of 2008, compared with 17,325 births during the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily due to more first-order births. With the recent enhancement of the Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Package, the Government hopes to support more Singaporeans in getting married and having and raising children. (See Annex A for the M&P Package take-up rates.)

#### **IMMIGRATION**

More new permanent residents and new citizens. There were more foreigners becoming PRs and citizens, with 34,800 granted PRs and 9,600 granted citizenship in the first six months of 2008, compared to 28,500 and 7,300 in the first six months in 2007 respectively. 77% of the new PRs aged 20 years and over had post-secondary qualifications; the corresponding figure was 62% for new citizens aged 20 and over. This compares favourably with the 36% among our existing citizen stock aged 20 years and over. The Government will continue to exercise discretion and facilitate the naturalisation of suitable foreigners who can add value and contribute to Singapore socially and economically.

#### **OVERSEAS SINGAPOREANS**

More Singaporeans going overseas for work and study. As of June 2008, there were about 153,500 overseas Singaporeans (OS) compared with 147,500 a year ago. The countries with a high concentration of OS are Australia, the UK, the US and China. Mr Quek, who also heads the Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU), noted that “having more Singaporeans go overseas is not a problem per se, so long as they stay engaged and connected with Singapore. The fact that many Overseas Singaporeans have done well in other countries attests to the success of the Singaporean system in producing top students, professionals and entrepreneurs who can succeed outside of Singapore. We should celebrate their successes and help them stay connected to home, so that they remain Singaporeans in their hearts and minds even when they are physically away from the rest of us”.
