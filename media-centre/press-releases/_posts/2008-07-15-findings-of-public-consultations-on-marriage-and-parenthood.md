The National Population Secretariat (NPS) in the Prime Minister’s Office worked with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), REACH and the National Family Council (NFC) to facilitate a series of public consultation sessions involving more than 300 participants from April to July 2008, to seek feedback on the marriage and parenthood (M&P) situation in Singapore.

The purpose of the consultation exercise was to enable the Government to better understand the impact of the last Marriage and Parenthood review in 2004, which introduced a package of measures to try and encourage more marriages and births in Singapore.

The 2004 package seems to have arrested the decline in the total fertility rate (TFR) since 2004. After hitting a low of 35,135 in 2004, the number of resident births has increased slightly each year since 2005 and reached 37,074 in 2007. However, our TFR stands at 1.29, a long way below replacement level of 2.1 and one of the lowest in the world.

In MCYS’s survey which polled about 6,000 respondents to understand their perceptions and attitudes towards M&P, 85% of single respondents still desire to marry and almost 80% of married respondents would want two or three children. An encouraging 83% of respondents also felt that the 2004 M&P package had helped to create a more pro-family environment in Singapore.

At the consultation sessions, the public gave feedback on the barriers to translate Singaporeans’ desire for relationship, marriage and parenthood into reality. The key findings are as below:

_**Socialisation was viewed as the first step towards marriage and subsequent parenthood.**_ While costs could delay marriages, the determining factor was more often than not the ability to meet a suitable partner. Key challenges in socialisation and marriage are as follows:

* a. For singles, the common feedback was that they were _**unable to find suitable partners**_ or would rather focus on their career ahead of marriage. Many singles had no time to socialise after starting work or did not know how to start. Some participants were also of the view that matchmaking agencies are too profit-oriented and not overly concerned about making matches.

* b. For those who were in a serious relationship, some considered _**having a residence of their own as important**_ before they would consider marriage; yet others said that it should not be a factor.

_**For couples, financial security, time and childcare arrangements were three key considerations.**_ In particular, parenthood was increasingly viewed as a shared responsibility between the couple as women wanted to have children and work at the same time. Key factors cited as challenges to having and raising children were as follows:

 * i. _**Financial concerns:**_ The costs of bringing up a family in Singapore were high, especially when tertiary education for children was taken into consideration at the point of deciding whether or not to have (more) children. There were suggestions for fathers to be allowed to claim tax benefits currently meant only for working mothers, especially if the couple includes a stay-at-home mother.
 * ii. _**Lack of work-life balance:**_ There seemed to be social stigma in leaving the office on time, much less taking time off for family. Some women said they were afraid of losing their jobs or that their positions would not be kept for them if they took longer leave to care for their children. Women generally wanted a career and children at the same time but it was a challenge trying to manage and balance both. Some participants noted that other seemingly non-related policies could have an effect on work-life balance, e.g. timing of ERP charges could discourage people from going home early.
 * iii. _**Lack of quality and affordable infant-care and childcare facilities:**_ Many couples did not want their children to be raised by domestic workers. However, there seemed to be a lack of mid-range infant-care and childcare centres that were affordable and of good quality. 

**Conclusion**

There were three running themes across socialisation and marriage, and having and raising children that could affect Singaporeans from trying to fulfil their personal M&P goals:


* a. _**Financial support:**_ While financial support in itself was insufficient to encourage participants to have another child, it was deemed necessary to provide support to some extent given rising costs.
Work-life balance: Demanding work commitments could hamper social and family life for both singles and parents.
Overall pro-family environment: The Government, the employers and the community all had a role to play in fostering an overall pro-family environment. The Government could help by providing targeted support coupled with suitable and consistent messaging; the employers needed to be more supportive; and the community should have the right infrastructure in terms of facilitating socialisation opportunities and the provision of quality and affordable childcare, and the right heartware in terms of a more profamily mindset.  


* b. _**Work-life balance:**_ Demanding work commitments could hamper social and family life for both singles and parents.
* c. _**Overall pro-family environment:**_ The Government, the employers and the community all had a role to play in fostering an overall pro-family environment. The Government could help by providing targeted support coupled with suitable and consistent messaging; the employers needed to be more supportive; and the community should have the right infrastructure in terms of facilitating socialisation opportunities and the provision of quality and affordable childcare, and the right heartware in terms of a more profamily mindset.  

The key findings of the public consultation sessions will help the Government to see if and how it can support couples in getting married and having children. The Government recognises that getting married and having children is ultimately a personal decision; it can only facilitate and support that desire and help turn it into a reality.

**MARRIAGE AND PARENTHOOD STUDY 2007**

The Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Study 2007 is a survey commissioned by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) which seeks to understand the attitudes and perceptions of Singapore residents towards marriage and parenthood.  

A similar study was completed in 2004. This second M&P Study was completed in 2007, surveying a total of 3,015 single (never married) and 3,006 married residents of Singapore. The key findings across both studies are compared below.

**Marriage remains desirable**

The 2007 survey found that the percentage of single respondents who desire to marry had increased from 74% in the 2004 survey to 85% in the 2007 survey. The top 2 reasons cited for not marrying continue to be not having met a suitable partner (compatible and of good character); and choosing to concentrate on their studies or career. Single respondents appear to be more active in searching for a marriage partner now as the percentage of those who were ambivalent about marriage decreased from 21% in 2004 to 13% in 2007. (Please refer to Annex A, Diagram 1 and Table 1)

**Home ownership closely associated with marriage**

Most of those **single respondents (89%) in the 2007 survey who planned to marry their current partners preferred to live together in their own homes after marriage.** Almost a third of them indicated that they would postpone their wedding if they were unable to have a place of their own. (Please refer to Annex A, Diagrams 2 and 3)

**More intend to have 2 or 3 children**  

Most married respondents from the 2004 and 2007 surveys cited **starting a family as either the most important or the second most important reason for getting married.** (Please refer to Annex A, Diagram 4)

In terms of the intended number of children, almost 8 in 10 of married respondents in the 2007 survey wanted 2 or 3 children. This was an increase from the 2004 survey, where slightly more than 6 in 10 wanted the same number of children. There was little difference in the number of children that married males and females wanted; the majority of both genders intending to have 2 or 3 children also increased across both surveys.

The average number of children that all married respondents actually had at the point of survey was fewer than 2 children in 2004 (1.5 children) and 2007 (1.6 children). When asked if they had completed their family size, almost 4 in 10 married respondents from the 2007 survey said that they wanted at least one more child and most of them were confident of achieving this intention. Across both the 2004 and 2007 surveys, **overall family size stabilised at around 2 children for couples towards the end of their reproductive cycles** (i.e. those aged 40 to 44 years old). (Please refer to Annex A, Tables 2, 3 and 4 and Diagrams 5 and 6)

**Parenthood viewed as a shared responsibility**

While **financial security came in first on the respondents’ minds when considering the number of children they would have, the second most common factor cited as influencing their decision was spousal consensus.** Parenthood was viewed as a shared responsibility between the couple. This was consistent for both the 2004 and 2007 surveys. (Please refer to Annex A, Table 5)

**Women want both family and work at the same time**

**Over 80% of single and 60% of married female respondents indicated a preference to be a working mother**, i.e., to have a job and one or more children concurrently. This was consistent with the 2004 survey. However, the percentage of married women who had indicated in the 2007 survey that it was ideal to leave the workforce when they had children or when their children were still young increased by 5 percentage points (from 29% to 34%). This was likely due to the preference to take care of their young children themselves. (Please refer to Annex A, Table 6 and Diagram 7)

**Parents want reliable, affordable, accessible and quality child care**

In terms of child care arrangements, majority (70%) of parents had highlighted that **“trust” in the caregiver was the most important factor influencing their decision on their current child care arrangement.** Apart from finding the caregiver reliable, **affordability was the next most important factor** on parents’ minds. The other factors influencing parents’ choice of child care arrangements included whether the caregiver was able to care for and develop the child and proximity of the caregiver to their homes. (Please refer to Annex A, Diagram 8)

**Impact of marriage and parenthood measures**

In 2004, the Government enhanced existing pro-family measures and introduced new initiatives to create a more conducive environment for couples to start and raise a family. (Please refer to Annex B for more details on the 2004 marriage and parenthood package)

The 2007 survey found that **83% of respondents agreed that the current marriage and parenthood package had created a more family-friendly environment** conducive for having and raising children. More than 7 in 10 respondents also found current measures easy to understand. Amongst the current measures, the Baby Bonus and extended Paid Maternity Leave schemes were the two most influential policies that would persuade respondents to have more children and to have them earlier. (Please refer to Annex A, Tables 7 and 8)
