The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) in the Strategy Group, Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, together with its community partners, will be running a series of engagements to listen to the needs and concerns of Singaporeans surrounding marriage and parenthood, and seek their suggestions for strengthening support. We would also like to partner more Singaporeans and the community in co-creating initiatives to make Singapore a great place for families.

There are several areas and ways in which Singaporeans and community groups can get involved. They can, for instance, suggest ways to foster a more profamily workplace culture, encourage greater sharing of parenting responsibilities between spouses, and create more opportunities for youths to widen their social circles. This initiative to embark on more concerted consultation efforts and partnerships with Singaporeans and community partners was first shared by Minister Josephine Teo (Minister for Manpower & Second Minister for Home Affairs, who also oversees Population matters) at the Committee of Supply Debate in February 2019.
