### THIRTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE
### WRITTEN ANSWER***
### _MONDAY, 13 FEBRUARY 2019

*Mr Gan Thiam Poh:*

To ask the Prime Minister (a) what has been the average size per household in each constituency for each of the past five years; and (b) what measures will the Government take to address the declining population in constituencies that face a shrinking population size and age.

Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister):

The Government does not track the average household size by constituency on an ongoing basis.

For planning purposes, the Government tracks the average household size by Planning Area. The average resident household size across Singapore has decreased from 3.53 in 2012 to 3.30 in 2017. Average resident household sizes by Planning Area are shown in Table 1.

Agencies monitor population trends, such as the population size and age profile, to ensure adequate amenities and services in each Planning Area. For example, the Urban Redevelopment Authorityâ€™s geospatial planning tools enable the Ministry of Health to plan the locations of Senior Care Centres, by prioritising areas with a higher number of seniors with disabilities.

In addition, the Housing and Development Board continues to build new flats in older estates, to ensure that all estates remain vibrant with a healthy mix of residents of different generations.

The Government continues to monitor the distribution of the population across Planning Areas and take steps in a timely way to meet the different needs of Singaporeans.
