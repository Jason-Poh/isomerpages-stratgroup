#### **OVERVIEW**

Mr Speaker, Sir. I thank the Members for raising important issues concerning our population growth, immigration and integration between Singapore-born citizens and our new compatriots this afternoon, as well as during the Budget Debate. Members have raised many key issues, including the impact of significant increases of foreigners in our midst competing for jobs with Singaporeans, the impact of immigration on the social fabric of Singapore and the value of citizenship. Many Singaporeans have also given suggestions on how to deal with our population challenge. I am encouraged that they have taken a personal interest in this serious challenge that we face today.

Let me begin by putting the population challenge and our strategies in their proper context.

#### **A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL SINGAPOREANS**

Indeed, attracting the right talent into Singapore is an important part of our overall population strategy. 

**Economic growth is key** 

We have developed our economy rapidly, and very successfully, in the past 40 years. Now, we have to scale new and multiple peaks; to keep our economy going, to create more jobs and to provide a better life for Singaporeans.

The only way for this to happen is to ensure continued economic growth. To do this, we need a critical mass of **able** and **willing** Singaporeans. **Able** to adapt to and meet the changing needs of the global economy; and **Willing** to do what is needed to ensure a better life for themselves, their children and fellow Singaporeans.

Singaporeans are indeed able and willing. But, there is just one problem – there aren’t enough of us and our population is fast ageing. We have not been replacing ourselves through local births since 1976 – 31 years ago. Even assuming current immigration trends with an average of 8,000 new citizens a year between 2001 and 2005, the number of deaths each year could outstrip births as early as 2030. In fact, if we do not have an inflow of new immigrants, our population will start to decline even earlier, by 2020, like Japan’s in 2005. This is why we have decided that encouraging immigration has to be a key strategy in tackling our population challenge. 

Indeed, we are now in what I call a “BBC” world, one that is “Boundless, Borderless and Competitive”. There will be “Boundless” opportunities for many in an increasingly “Borderless” world; at the same time, the stakes are much higher and a lot more “Competitive”. Many countries are trying hard to attract people to sink roots in their country. Why? The answer is simple – immigrants have helped many economies grow beyond their inherent potential. 


* a. The US has attracted waves of immigrants since the 17th century. Europeans, Africans, Latin Americans and in the last few decades, Asians – they have all come to call the US home over the years. What have they brought to the US

* * First, more jobs – a Pew report found that in most states in the US where immigration levels were high, employment prospects were above national average.

* * Second, a stronger economy – back in 1997, the National Academy of Science had already concluded in its report for the US Congress that immigration had brought a net benefit of US$10 billion to the US economy.

* * Third, more births – the US Centre for Immigration Studies estimated that 23% of all babies born in the US in 2002 had a foreign-born mother.

* b. Australia’s net overseas immigration has accounted for more than 45% of its population growth since 1998. In 2005, 24% of Australians were born overseas. Yet in the same year, it embarked on its biggest recruitment drive for skilled workers such as hairdressers, mechanics, pharmacists and accountants, in more than 40 cities worldwide, including Chennai, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok and even Singapore – targeting not only our university or polytechnic graduates, but also our ITE graduates.

#### **Implications for Singapore** 

What does this mean for Singapore, or more to the point, can Singapore afford to close its doors to immigrants? 

* a. _**People are our key and only resource.**_ Let me put it bluntly – we need all the talents we can get, be they locals or immigrants. We are not producing enough babies; we do not produce enough engineers, bankers, technicians, artists and even chefs of our own.

* b. _**Who gets to benefit at the end of it?**_ Locals. Look at our wafer fabrication industry. As of 2005, there were 15,000 positions in the industry – 8,000 operators and 7,000 engineers. Singaporeans and PRs could only fill 80% of the higher-skilled engineer positions and one-third of the positions for operators. If we did not have qualified foreign engineers and operators here, these wafer fabs will relocate elsewhere.

* c. _**Thus far, the outcome of our open-door policy to support and stimulate economic growth has been positive.**_ Many Singaporeans have benefited from this. In 2006, a record of more than 173,000 jobs was created. Locals took up more than half of them. With the upcoming IRs, we can expect more job opportunities in the services sector such as tourism and entertainment, finance and hospitality. In the maritime sector, the labour shortage is so acute that Keppel Corp had to tie up with MediaCorp to profile this industry in a local TV serial. There are jobs available – but we must have the critical mass of able and willing people. Where we lack local manpower, we have to bring in new immigrants. Even if we do not bring them in, they can and will still compete against us from their home countries.
