Last few years, when conditions were good, we did the right thing planning well ahead

* d. When the global economy recovers, we will bounce back up

#### **INFLATION**

Hottest issue for Singaporeans is the rising cost of living

* * * 1. 8 years ago – US$20 per barrel
* * * 2.Today – around US$110 per barrel
* * ii. Price of rice (Slide 2)
* * * 1. 8 years ago – US$200 per ton
* * * 2. Today – around US$800 per ton
* b. People are agitated all over the world
* * i. Demonstrating and rioting 
* * * 1. In Europe
* * * * a. Truckers in France (Slide 3)
* * * * b. Farmers in Spain (Slide 4)
* * * 2. In Asia
* * * * a. Fuel protests in Indonesia (Slide 5)
* * * * b. Food protests in Pakistan (Slide 6)
* * * * c. Rice protests in Philippines, with long queues for subsidised rice (Slide 7)
* * ii. In Singapore
* * * 1. Fortunately, we have plenty of rice (Slide 8)
* * * 2. No protests or demonstrations
* * * 3. But I know people are also unhappy about price increases
* * * 4. Many pictures on the internet. My favourite (Slide 9)
* c. Completely understand how Singaporeans feel
* * i. But we should react rationally
* *  ii. Understand why it is happening to us, and what we can do about it

We cannot prevent prices from rising in Singapore

We import most of our food, except a few eggs and some fish
We import all our fuel, and produce all our electricity from imported oil and natural gas
When world prices go up, how do we keep our rice, petrol, or electricity prices down?
In terms of dollars, wages have not gone down
Most workers are earning more dollars this year
Last year was a good year; wages and bonuses went up
But when we spend money, we find that each dollar has shrunk
With inflation, some of your wage increase went to you, but quite a lot went to the oil producers
Simply put, oil producers (e.g. Arabs and Russians) are now richer, therefore oil consumers (e. us) are now poorer
Singaporeans wish the Government would do something to keep prices from rising, e.g. just control prices, and not let them go up
